class Point {'constructoren.txt'

  }
}
-----------------------------------------
class Point {
  num x, y;

  // Syntactic sugar for setting x and y
  // before the constructor body runs.
  Point(this.x, this.y);
}
-------------------------------------------------
If you don’t declare a constructor, a default constructor is provided for you.
The default constructor has no arguments and invokes the no-argument constructor in the superclass.
Subclasses don’t inherit constructors from their superclass.
A subclass that declares no constructors has only the default (no argument, no name) constructor.
----------------------------------------------
Use a named constructor to implement multiple constructors for a class or to provide extra clarity:
class Point {
  num x, y;

  Point(this.x, this.y);

  // Named constructor
  Point.origin() {
    x = 0;
    y = 0;
  }
}
--------------------------------------------
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  final String title;
  MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);

  declares 2 optional named parameters (optional named because of {}) where
  the first is of name key with type Key.
  Tthe 2nd is of name title with the type of the field this.title and automatically initializes this.title with the passed value This is nice syntactic sugar that saves some writing.

  : starts the initializer list. The initializer list allows some to execute some expressions before the call is forwarded to the constructor of the super class.

  When a class is initialized, read access to this is forbidden until the call to the super constructor is completed (until the body of the constructor is executed - in your example the constructor has no body).

  The initializer list is often use to validate passed parameter values with assert(key != null) or to initialize final fields with calculated values (final fields can't be initialized or updated later).

  super(key: key) forwards to the constructor of the super class and passes the parameter key passed to MyHomepage to the super constructors key parameter (same as for MyHomepage({Key key})).
