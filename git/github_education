1 Organisation pro Kurs pro Semester
1 Repo pro Student pro Assignment


1 org per course per semester
1 repo per assignment per student

You can re-use your orgs semester to semester. I recommend keeping one canonical “golden” org with your latest materials in it, and then copying it each semester.

The repos (1 per assignment) can have both starter code and your static materials
(we mostly use static materials for this course.

I don’t really see the difference between commit and push in this case of students,
I mean it would be fine by me for them to push after every commit,
or only when they finish the whole thing for submission.

Commit–snapshot of student work.
Push–when they want to send a copy of that work to GitHub to back it up and share it.
I would recommend they push when they can, especially with regards to group work.
